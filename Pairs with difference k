Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Find the number of pairs of integers
whose difference equals a given number k.
Note: (a, b) and (b, a) are considered the same. Also, the same numbers at different indices are considered different.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 pairs with difference 3,the pairs are {1, 4} and {5, 2}
