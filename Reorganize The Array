Given an array of elements arr[] with indices ranging from 0 to arr.size() - 1, your task is to
write a program that rearranges the elements of the array such that arr[i] = i. If an element
i is not present in the array, -1 should be placed at the corresponding index.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1]
Output: [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]
