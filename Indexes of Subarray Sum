Given an array arr[] containing only non-negative integers, your task is to find a continuous subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) 
whose sum equals a specified value target. You need to return the 1-based indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray. 
You need to find the first subarray whose sum is equal to the target.

Note: If no such array is possible then, return [-1].
