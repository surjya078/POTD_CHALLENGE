A matrix is constructed of size n*n and given an integer ‘q’. The value at every cell of the matrix is given as, M(i,j) = i+j, where ‘M(i,j)' is the value of a cell, ‘i’ is the row number, and ‘j’ is the column number. Return the number of cells having value ‘q’.

Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, q = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 
3 4 5 6 
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
The count of 7 is 2.
Input: n = 5, q = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 6 
3 4 5 6 7 
4 5 6 7 8 
5 6 7 8 9 
6 7 8 9 10 
The count of 4 is 3.



ANSWER:-

class Solution {
    static long sumMatrix(long n, long q) {
        // code here
           if(q<2 || q>2*n)
        return 0;
        else if(q<=n+1)
        return q-1;
        else
        return 2*n-(q-1);
    }
}
