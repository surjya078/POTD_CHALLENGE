Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines,
find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 2 distance apart. So the size of the base is 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 3 * 2 = 6.

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 12
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 4 distance apart. So the size of the base is 4. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 4 * 3 = 12.
