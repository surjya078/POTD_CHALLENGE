Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

Input: s = "bbabcbcab"
Output: 7
Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are palindromic and all have a length 1.
