Given a strictly sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and a number x. Find whether the number x is present in the matrix or not.
Note: In a strictly sorted matrix, each row is sorted in strictly increasing order, and the first element of the ith row (i!=0) is greater than the last element of the (i-1)th row.
