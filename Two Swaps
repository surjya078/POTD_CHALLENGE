Given a permutation of some of the first natural numbers in an array arr[], determine if the array can be sorted in exactly two swaps. 
A swap can involve the same pair of indices twice.

Return true if it is possible to sort the array with exactly two swaps, otherwise return false.


Examples:

Input: arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: true
