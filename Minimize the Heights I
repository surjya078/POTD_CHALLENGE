Given a positive integer k and an array arr[] denoting heights of towers, you have to modify the height 
of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by k only once.
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers 
after you have modified each tower.

Note: A slight modification of the problem can be found here. 

Examples:

Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as [3, 3, 6, 8]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8 - 3 = 5.
