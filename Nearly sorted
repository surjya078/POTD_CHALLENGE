Given an array arr[], where each element is at most k away from its target position, you need to sort the array optimally.

Note: DO NOT use STL sort() function for this question.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9], k = 3
Output: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
Explanation: The sorted array will be 2 3 5 6 8 9 10
