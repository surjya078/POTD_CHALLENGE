Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to find the first equilibrium point in the array.

The equilibrium point in an array is an index (0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the
same as the sum of elements after it. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 3]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The sum of left of index 2 is 1 + 2 = 3 and sum on right of index 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.
