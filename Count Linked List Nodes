Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.

Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.


ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
     public int getCount(Node head) {
        // code here
        int count=0;
        
        Node temp=head;
        while(temp!=null){
            count++;
            temp=temp.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
