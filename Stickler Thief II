You are given an array arr[] which represents houses arranged in a circle, where each house has a certain value. A thief aims to maximize the 
total stolen value without robbing two adjacent houses.

Determine the maximum amount the thief can steal.

Note: Since the houses are in a circle, the first and last houses are also considered adjacent.
