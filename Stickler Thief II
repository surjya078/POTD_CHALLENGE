You are given an array arr[] which represents houses arranged in a circle, where each house has a certain value. A thief aims to maximize the 
total stolen value without robbing two adjacent houses.

Determine the maximum amount the thief can steal.

Note: Since the houses are in a circle, the first and last houses are also considered adjacent.

Examples :-

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: arr[0] and arr[2] can't be robbed because they are adjacent houses. Thus, 3 is the maximum value thief can rob.
