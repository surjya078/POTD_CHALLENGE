Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space.
Modify a so that it contains the first n elements and modify b so that it contains the last m elements.

Examples:

Input: a[] = [2, 4, 7, 10], b[] = [2, 3]
Output:
2 2 3 4
7 10
Explanation: After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 2 2 3 4 7 10
