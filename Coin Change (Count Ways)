Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum
by using different combinations from coins[ ]. 

Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer. 

Examples:

Input: coins[] = [1, 2, 3], sum = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: Four Possible ways are: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3].
