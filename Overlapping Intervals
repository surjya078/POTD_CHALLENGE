Given an array of Intervals arr[][], where arr[i] = [starti, endi]. The task is to merge all of the overlapping Intervals.

Examples:

Input: arr[][] = [[1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10]]
Output: [[1,4], [6,8], [9,10]]
Explanation: In the given intervals we have only two overlapping intervals here, [1,3] and [2,4] which on merging will become [1,4]. Therefore we will return [[1,4], [6,8], [9,10]].
