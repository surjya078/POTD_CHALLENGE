Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot two consecutive houses and aims to maximize his total loot.

Given an array, arr[] where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.

Determine the maximum amount he can loot. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 5, 7, 4]
Output: 15
Explanation: Maximum amount he can get by looting 1st, 3rd and 5th house. Which is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. 
 
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: Loot only 2nd house and get maximum amount of 5.

Input: arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: 8
Explanation: The optimal choice is to loot every alternate house. Looting the 1st and 3rd houses, or the 2nd and 4th, both give a maximum total of 4 + 4 = 8.


ANSWER :-

class Solution {

public int solveMem(int [] arr, int idx, int [] dp){
        if(idx >= arr.length){
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp[idx] != -1){
            return dp[idx];
        }
        int include = solveMem(arr,idx + 1,dp);
        int exclude = arr[idx] + solveMem(arr,idx + 2,dp);
        return dp[idx] = Math.max(include,exclude);
    }

public int findMaxSum(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int [] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
        return solveMem(arr,0,dp);
    }
}
