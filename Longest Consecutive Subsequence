Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements
in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The consecutive numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 numbers form the longest consecutive subsquence.
