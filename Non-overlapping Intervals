Given a 2D array intervals[][] of representing intervals where intervals [i] = [starti, endi ]. 
Return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Examples:

Input: intervals[][] = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1, 3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
