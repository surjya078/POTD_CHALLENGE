Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to count the number of ways to split given array 
elements into two non-empty subsets such that the XOR of elements of each group is 
equal. Each element should belong to exactly one subset.

Note:

1. The answer could be very large so print it by doing modulo with 109 + 7. 
2. Subsets with the same elements but derived from different indices are different.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output : 3
Explanation: {(1),(2, 3)}, {(2),(1, 3)}, {(3),(1, 2)} are three ways with equal XOR value of two groups.

Input : arr[] = [5, 2, 3, 2]
Output : 0
Explanation: No way to split into  two groups whose XOR is equal.
