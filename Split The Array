Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to count the number of ways to split given array 
elements into two non-empty subsets such that the XOR of elements of each group is 
equal. Each element should belong to exactly one subset.

Note:

The answer could be very large so print it by doing modulo with 109 + 7. 
Subsets with the same elements but derived from different indices are different.
