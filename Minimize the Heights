Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Examples :

Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 


ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int k) {
        // code here
          int n=arr.length;
        int max=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int min=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int res=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>k){
                max=Math.max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
                min=Math.min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
                res=Math.min(res,max-min);
                
            }else continue;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
