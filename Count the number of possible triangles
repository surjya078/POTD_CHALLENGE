Given an integer array arr[]. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements
as lengths of three sides of the triangle. 

. A triangle with three given sides is only possible if sum of any two sides is always greater than the third side.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 6, 3, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three triangles possible [3, 4, 6], [4, 6, 7] and [3, 6, 7]. Note that [3, 4, 7] is not a possible triangle.
