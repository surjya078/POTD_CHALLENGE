Given a string s, your task is to find the longest palindromic substring within s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, defined as s[i...j] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(s).

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. More formally, s is a palindrome if reverse(s) == s.

Note: If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same length, return the first occurrence of the longest palindromic substring from left to right.
