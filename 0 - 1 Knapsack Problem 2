Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, the task is to put the items in the knapsack
such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 

Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.

Examples :

Input: W = 4, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 1] 
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the last item, which weighs 1 unit and has a value of 3.

Input: W = 3, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 6] 
Output: 0
Explanation: Every item has a weight exceeding the knapsack's capacity (3).
