Given an array, arr[], determine if arr can be split into
three consecutive parts such that the sum of each part is 
equal. If possible, return any index pair(i, j) in an array 
such that sum(arr[0..i]) = sum(arr[i+1..j]) = sum(arr[j+1..n-1]), 
otherwise return an array {-1,-1}.

Note: Driver code will print true if arr can be split into three equal sum subarrays, otherwise, it is false.
