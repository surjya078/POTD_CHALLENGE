ou are given two strings str1 and str2. Your task is to find the length of the longest common substring among the given strings.

Examples:

Input: str1 = "ABCDGH", str2 = "ACDGHR"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest common substring is "CDGH" which has length 4.
Input: str1 = "ABC", str2 = "ACB"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest common substrings are "A", "B", "C" all having length 1.

ANSWER :-

class Solution {
     public int longestCommonSubstr(String str1, String str2) {
        int n = str1.length();
        int m = str2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i][j]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
