You are given the head of a singly linked list. Your task is to determine if the linked list contains a loop.
A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, 
it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.
