Given two arrays representing the inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree, construct the tree and return the root node of the constructed tree.

Note: The output is written in postorder traversal.

Examples:

nput: inorder[] = [1, 6, 8, 7], preorder[] = [1, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [8, 7, 6, 1]
Explanation: The tree will look like

Input: inorder[] = [3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 5], preorder[] = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
Output: [3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 0]
Explanation: The tree will look like
