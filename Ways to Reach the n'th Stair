There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. 
Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to climb 1 stair. 

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 ways to reach 2th stair: {1, 1} and {2}. 

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five ways to reach 4th stair: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1} and {2, 2}.


ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    int countWays(int n) {
        int prev1 = 1;
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        int prev2 = 2;
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int next = prev1 + prev2;
            prev1 = prev2;
            prev2 = next;
        }
        return prev2;
    }
}
