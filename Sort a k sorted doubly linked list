Given a doubly linked list, each node is at most k-indices away from its target position. The problem is
to sort the given doubly linked list. The distance can be assumed in either of the directions (left and right)

Examples :

Input: Doubly Linked List : 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 4 , k = 2
Output: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6
