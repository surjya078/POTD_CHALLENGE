Given an array arr[] of n sorted linked lists of different sizes. The task is to merge them in such a way that after merging they
will be a single sorted linked list, then return the head of the merged linked list.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1 -> 2 -> 3, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 7 -> 8]
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
Explanation:
The arr[] has 4 sorted linked list of size 3, 2, 2, 2.
1st list: 1 -> 2-> 3
2nd list: 4 -> 5
3rd list: 5 -> 6
4th list: 7 -> 8
The merged list will be:
