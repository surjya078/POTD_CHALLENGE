Given an array arr[] with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element.

Note: You may assume that every input array has repetitions.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
Output: 5
Explanation: distance for 1 is: 5-0 = 5, distance for 2 is : 4-2 = 2, So max distance is 5.
