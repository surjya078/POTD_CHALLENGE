Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, the task is to find the length of the Longest Strictly Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

A subsequence is strictly increasing if each element in the subsequence is strictly less than the next element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [5, 7, 9], which has a length of 3.
