Given an array arr[], find all possible
indices [i, j, k] of triplets [arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]] 
in the array whose sum is equal to zero. Return indices of triplets in any order and all the
returned triplets indices should also be
internally sorted, i.e., for any triplet indices [i, j, k], the 
condition i < j < k should hold.

Note: Try to solve this using the O(n2) approach.
