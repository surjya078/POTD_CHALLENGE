Given a linked list, your task is to complete the function 
isLengthEven() which contains the head
of the linked list, and check whether the length of the linked list
is even or not. Return true if it is even, otherwise false.

Examples:

Input: Linked list: 12->52->10->47->95->0
Output: true
Explanation: The length of the linked list is 6 which is even, hence returned true.

Input: Linked list: 9->4->3
Output: false
Explanation: The length of the linked list is 3 which is odd, hence returned false.



ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    public boolean isLengthEven(Node head) {
        // code here
               int count=0;
        while(head!=null) {
            head=head.next;
            count++;
        }
        return count%2==0;
    }
}
