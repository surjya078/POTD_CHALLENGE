A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people.  A square matrix mat is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[0 1 0],
                [0 0 0], 
                [0 1 0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 
Input: mat[][] = [[0 1],
                [1 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The two people at the party both know each other. None of them is a celebrity.

ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    // Function to find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    public int celebrity(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length, j = 0;
      // j= 0 , means assuming first person as celebrity
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
      // if j knows i , means that i might be the celebrity 
            if(knows(mat, j , i)) j = i;
        }
       // j is celebrity only if j does not know i or every other person know j
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(j != i && (knows(mat, j, i) || !knows(mat, i, j))) return -1;
        }
        return j;
    }
   // to check whether a knows b or not
    private boolean knows(int[][] m, int a, int b){
        return m[a][b] == 1;
    }
}
