Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10… and 5th missing number is 9.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Missing are 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 5.
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Missing are 1, 2, 4, 6… and 2nd missing number is 2.


ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    public int kthMissing(int[] arr, int k) {
        int missingCount = 0;
        int current = 1; // Start checking from 1
        int index = 0;

        while (true) {
            // Check if the current number is missing
            if (index < arr.length && arr[index] == current) {
                // Number is in the array; move to the next array element
                index++;
            } else {
                // Number is missing
                missingCount++;
                if (missingCount == k) {
                    return current; // Found the k-th missing number
                }
            }
            current++; // Move to the next number
        }
    }
}
