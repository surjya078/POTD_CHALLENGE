Given q queries, You task is to implement the following four functions for a stack:

1. push(x) – Insert an integer x onto the stack.
2. pop() – Remove the top element from the stack.
3. peek() - Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.
4. getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time. If the stack is empty, return -1.

Each query can be one of the following:

1 x : Push x onto the stack.
2 : Pop the top element from the stack.
3: Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.
4: Return the minimum element from the stack.

Examples:

Input: q = 7, queries = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3], [2], [4], [1, 1], [4]]
Output: [3, 2, 1]
Explanation: 
push(2): Stack is [2]
push(3): Stack is [2, 3]
peek(): Top element is 3
pop(): Removes 3, stack is [2]
getMin(): Minimum element is 2
push(1): Stack is [2, 1]
getMin(): Minimum element is 1
