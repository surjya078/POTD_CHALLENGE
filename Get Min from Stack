Given q queries, You task is to implement the following four functions for a stack:

1. push(x) – Insert an integer x onto the stack.
2. pop() – Remove the top element from the stack.
3. peek() - Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.
4. getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time. If the stack is empty, return -1.

Each query can be one of the following:

1 x : Push x onto the stack.
2 : Pop the top element from the stack.
3: Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.
4: Return the minimum element from the stack.
