Given a BST and an integer k, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the BST. If there is no kth smallest element present then return -1.

Examples:

Input: root = [2, 1, 3], k = 2
    
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is the 2nd smallest element in the BST.

Input: root = [2, 1, 3], k = 5
    
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no 5th smallest element in the BST as the size of BST is 3.
