Given an array arr[ ], your task is to find the minimum number of increment operations required to make all the elements of the array unique. i.e.- no value in the array should occur more than once. In one operation, a value can be incremented by 1 only.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: If we increase arr[2] by 1 then the resulting array becomes {1, 2, 3} and has all unique values.Hence, the answer is 1 in this case.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: If we increase arr[0] by 3, then all array elements will be unique. Hence, the answer is 3 in this case.
Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All elements are unique.



ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    public int minIncrements(int[] arr) {
        // Code here
        int []Ocurrence = new int[1000000 + 5];
        
        int count=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            Ocurrence[arr[i]]++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<Ocurrence.length;i++){
            
            while(Ocurrence[i]>1){
                int nextNum = i+1;
                
                while(Ocurrence[nextNum]>0){
                    nextNum++;
                }
                
                Ocurrence[i]--;
                Ocurrence[nextNum]++;
                count +=nextNum-i;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
