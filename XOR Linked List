An ordinary Doubly Linked List requires space for two address fields to store the addresses
of previous and next nodes. A memory-efficient version of the Doubly Linked List can be created using only one space for the address field with every node. This memory-efficient
Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the list uses bit-wise XOR operation to save space for one address.

Given a stream of data of size N for the linked list, your task is to complete the function insert() and getList(). 
The insert() function pushes (or inserts at the beginning) the givendata in the linked list and the getList()  function returns the linked list as a list.
