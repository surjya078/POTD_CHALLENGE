Given a root of a binary tree with n nodes, the task is to find its level order traversal. Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3]
          1
         / \
        2   3
Output: [[1], [2, 3]]4

Input: root[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
          10
         /  \
        20   30
      /  \  
     40  50
Output: [[10], [20, 30], [40, 50]]
