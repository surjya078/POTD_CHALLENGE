Given an encoded string s, the task is to decode it. The encoding rule is :

k[encodedString], where the encodedString inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
Note: The test cases are generated so that the length of the output string will never exceed 105 .

Examples:

Input: s = "1[b]"
Output: "b"
Explanation: "b" is present only one time.

Input: s = "3[b2[ca]]"
Output: "bcacabcacabcaca" 
Explanation: 
1. Inner substring “2[ca]” breakdown into “caca”.
2. Now, new string becomes “3[bcaca]”
3. Similarly “3[bcaca]” becomes “bcacabcacabcaca ” which is final result.
 

ANSWER :-

class Solution {
    public String decodeString(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> numStack = new Stack<>();  // Stack for repeat counts
        Stack<StringBuilder> strStack = new Stack<>();  // Stack for strings
        StringBuilder current = new StringBuilder();  // Keep the track of current String 
        int num = 0;  // Current number is being parsed
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                num = num * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else if (c == '[') { // pushing number and the current String and resetting it
                numStack.push(num);
                strStack.push(current);
                num = 0;
                current = new StringBuilder();
            } else if (c == ']') { // poping the elements from the stack and after that appending the string 
                int repeat = numStack.pop();
                StringBuilder temp = current;
                current = strStack.pop();
                for (int i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
                    current.append(temp);
                }
            } else {
                current.append(c);
            }
        }
        return current.toString(); // converting in to string so that our result should be in string
    }
}
