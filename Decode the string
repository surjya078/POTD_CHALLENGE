Given an encoded string s, the task is to decode it. The encoding rule is :

k[encodedString], where the encodedString inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
Note: The test cases are generated so that the length of the output string will never exceed 105 .
