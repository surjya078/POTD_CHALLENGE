Design a data structure that works like a LRU Cache. Here cap denotes the capacity of the cache and Q denotes the number of queries. Query can be of two types:

1. PUT x y: sets the value of the key x with value y
2. GET x: gets the key of x if present else returns -1.

The LRUCache class has two methods get() and put() which are defined as follows.

1. get(key): returns the value of the key if it already exists in the cache otherwise returns -1.
2.
