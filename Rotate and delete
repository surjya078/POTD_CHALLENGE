Given an array arr integers. Assume sz to be the initial size of the array. Do the following operations exactly sz/2 times. In every kth (1<= k <= sz/2) operation:

Right-rotate the array clockwise by 1.
Delete the (nâ€“ k + 1)th element from begin.

Now, Return the first element of the array.
Note: Here n keeps on decreasing with every operation.
