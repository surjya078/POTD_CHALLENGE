Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 2 are present except 2.

ANSWER :-

class Solution {

    // Note that the size of the array is n-1
    int missingNumber(int n, int arr[]) {

        // Your Code Here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;++i) {
            if(arr[i]!=i+1) return i+1;
            
        }
        return n;
        
    }
}
